## Multiscale Attention-based Hand Keypoint Detection
**Abstract**—This paper deals with the measurement of the hand keypoints in a vision-based setup under different constraints. Hand keypoint detection plays a crucial role in many gesturebased applications. However, developing a generalized detection method has remained a long-standing problem. Several factors impede accurate detection: the fingers’ distance from the camera and their nearness, self-occlusion, variations in illumination, and background clutter. To overcome these barriers, we propose a two-stage architecture. The first stage generates precise hand regions, eliminating adjoining skin regions and background clutter. The second stage incorporates a novel multiscale attention block to detect keypoint coordinates precisely. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations found that the proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art models, with endpoint errors as low as 2.3, 1.14, and 2.11 pixels for the three benchmark datasets. This advancement lays the groundwork for future 3D hand pose estimation developments and their applications.
